## Used libraries
* React as main library;
* React-router for routing;
* Framer-Motion for animations;
* React-Icons for most icons apart the main logo;
* Styled-Components for general styling and componentization;

## Website Goal
The objective was to introduce people to the recently created NGO, the website shows it's history, goals and a way to contribute and contact to it.

## Original Idea x Final Project
[The project was prototyped on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/FH5EWAjHNAI4z0FqcS02KN/IGS---CDB?node-id=0%3A1). Project underwent changes mid-coding.   
The original website idea only had one route, it needed too much scrolling to hit it's bottom besides visual bugs and UX problems.    
The first atempt was made fully on vanilla HTML, JS and CSS. As a both personal curiosity and challenge, I created the new one using React.
